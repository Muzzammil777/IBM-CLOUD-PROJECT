# MedBot: AI-Powered Medical Assistant - Project Documentation

## Problem Statement

Healthcare accessibility remains a significant challenge globally, with millions of people lacking immediate access to medical professionals for initial symptom assessment and health guidance. Key issues include:

- **Limited Healthcare Access**: Rural and underserved communities often lack immediate access to medical professionals
- **Information Overload**: Patients struggle to find reliable, verified medical information online amid misinformation
- **Delayed Medical Attention**: People often ignore early symptoms or delay seeking help due to uncertainty about severity
- **Language Barriers**: Medical information is not always available in patients' native languages
- **Cost Concerns**: Initial consultations for minor symptoms can be expensive, deterring early intervention
- **Emergency Room Overcrowding**: Non-emergency cases burden emergency services due to lack of initial triage
- **Regional Health Awareness**: People lack awareness of location-specific health risks and outbreaks
- **Self-Diagnosis Risks**: Unreliable internet searches lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate self-treatment

These challenges result in delayed medical intervention, increased healthcare costs, and poor health outcomes, particularly affecting vulnerable populations who need accessible, reliable preliminary medical guidance.
